This course is an introduction to key design principles and techniques for interactively visualizing data. The major goals of this course are to understand how visual representations can help in the analysis and understanding of complex data, how to design effective visualizations, and how to create your own interactive visualizations using modern web-based frameworks.

This course, when taken for a letter grade, meets the Harvard General Education requirement for Empirical and Mathematical Reasoning. The course is also offered through the [Harvard University Extension School](http://www.extension.harvard.edu) as online course CSCI E-171.

After completion of the course you will be able to:

* Create web-based interactive visualizations using Javascript and D3
* Critically evaluate visualizations and suggest improvements and refinements
* Apply a structured design process to create effective visualizations
* Conceptualize ideas and interaction techniques using sketching and prototyping
* Use principles of human perception and cognition in visualization design
* Apply methods for visualization of data from a variety of fields
* Work constructively as a member of a team to carry out a complex project

## Course Format
CS171 uses an active learning format with a mix of lectures, activities, self-guided labs, homework, and group projects.

Here is the weekly rhythm of the course:

### Monday

Watch an orientation video (approx. 10 min) to get an idea of what we will cover each week.
*College Students:* Attend a mandatory live class (75 min) to participate in lectures, activities, discussions, and projects in breakout groups. In-person class attendance is mandatory except for DCE and exempt students.
*DCE Students:* Attend a virtual section (45 min) to participate in group discussions and group projects. In-person attendance is strongly encouraged, but you might be excused on an individual basis.

### Wednesday

Hand in your homework assignments at noon ET on Wednesdays.
*College Students:* Attend a mandatory programming lab (75 min) where you will work in small groups on self-guided lab notebooks to learn HMTL, CSS, Javascript, and D3. TFs will be available to help you. In-person lab attendance is mandatory except for DCE and exempt students.

### Thursday

*DCE Students:* Attend a virtual programming lab (75 min) where you will work in small groups on self-guided lab notebooks to learn HMTL, CSS, Javascript, and D3. TFs will be available to help you. In-person lab attendance is strongly encouraged, but you might be excused on an individual basis.
Throughout the week

Work through asynchronous materials (YouTube videos, websites, lecture videos, book chapters, etc.) that will be posted on Canvas.
Complete weekly homework assignments, which include finishing your lab notebooks, programming exercises, and work for your group project.
Attend office hours with the TFs to get help with the labs and homework assignments. DCE students can attend weekly sections with the TFs.  
Overall, expect to spend about 10 hours on asynchronous materials, homework, and project work outside of classes and labs. Students with less programming experience typically will spend more time.
Each of the course components is discussed in more detail below.

## Limited Enrollment
To provide the best possible online learning experience during live classes we have limited enrollment in the course.

*College Students:* If you are interested in joining this course please fill out the enrollment survey on Canvas before the posted deadline.

*DCE Students:* Sign up is on a first-come first-serve basis.

## Prerequisites
We require students to have taken a prior programming class, such as CS50 (Introduction to Programming) or similar. You should be comfortable picking up new programming skills. Having Javascript and web development experience is a big plus, but not strictly required. Please be aware that learning web development and D3 can be time-consuming, depending on your programming background.

## Required Textbook
In preparation for the weekly programming labs you will read chapters in the following textbook:

Interactive Data Visualization for the Web, Scott Murray, O’Reilly (2017), Second edition

An introduction to D3 for people new to programming and web development, published by O’Reilly. “Explaining tricky technical topics with aplomb (and a little cheeky humor) is Scott Murray’s forte. If you want to dive into the world of dynamic visualization using web standards, even if you are new to programming, this book is the place to start.” - Mike Bostock, creator of D3

Harvard College students can access an online copy of the book on Hollis, or you can purchase the book from the Coop bookstore or any other online retailer.

## Course Components

### Live Classes
*College students:* The class meets every Monday except during the first week when we are meeting on Wednesday. Attending these in-person classes is mandatory and a crucial component of learning the material in this course. Please arrive on time, as we will start promptly. At the end of each class, we will ask you to fill out and submit a brief reflection to collect feedback.

*DCE students:* Instead of attending class in person, DCE and exempt students can watch edited video recordings that will be posted no more than 24 hours after class. We also strongly encourage you to complete the in-class activities on your own. Additionally, we will hold a weekly section for the group-work part of the lecture for DCE students. Attendance is strongly encouraged, but not mandatory.

### Programming Labs
*College students:* You will attend a mandatory in-person programming lab every Wednesdays.

*DCE students:* Instead of attending labs in person, DCE and exempt students will have a weekly online lab on Thursdays to work on the lab alone or in pairs. Attendance is strongly encouraged, but not mandatory.



You will work through self-guided notebooks to learn client-side web programming with HTML, CSS, Javascript, and D3. You will work in pairs, and TFs will be available to help you. Completed lab notebooks need to be handed in with the homework each week. Solutions to labs will be made public the week after the lab has been published.

### Asynchronous Materials & Quizzes
In preparation for class each week, you will work on your own through asynchronous materials (YouTube videos, websites, lecture videos, book chapters, etc.) to ensure that you are prepared for the programming labs and the activities in class. You are expected to read and watch these materials posted on Canvas each week. You will be asked to complete brief online quizzes that test your understanding of the asynchronous materials for that week.

### Homework
Weekly homework assignments are going to provide an opportunity to improve your design and programming skills. Homeworks will be due every Wednesday at noon ET. See the homework as an opportunity to learn, and not to “earn points”. You can discuss solutions to homework assignments with your TFs during office hours. Homework solutions will not be posted publicly.

### Group Projects
A big part of the course will be two group projects. You will work in teams of three students to design and implement interactive visualizations to answer questions about a specific topic and dataset. We will use a design sprint process with a series of graded milestones.

At the beginning of the course, you will work on a guided project in teams assembled by us. Your team will choose one project from a set of topics, project briefs, and datasets. The guided project will familiarize you with the design sprint process and how to create interactive visualizations and dashboards using Tableau.

After the guided project, you will work on a final project for which you can choose your own team with three students each. Your team will create a web page that tells a story with interactive visualizations to answer questions about a topic of your own choosing. A small number of projects will win the coveted Best Project prize (Swiss chocolate).

### Office Hours & EdStem
The teaching fellows will provide online office hours at several different times each week for questions you may have. We will also use EdStem as our discussion forum and for all announcements, so it is important that you are signed up as soon as possible. EdStem should always be your first resource for seeking answers to your questions. You can also post privately so that only the course staff sees your message.

## Grading
This course can be taken for a letter grade only, there is no pass/fail option. The course grade comprises:

Participation (10%)
Quizzes (10%)
Homework Assignments (30%)
Guided Project (20%)
Final Project (30%)
Your participation grade includes watching lecture videos, participating in class and on EdStem, and being helpful to other students. We will drop your lowest quiz score. Any concerns about grading errors must be clearly articulated in writing and sent to <jbeyer@g.harvard.edu> within one week of receiving the grade.

We will map your points to letter grades using the following table:

A: 100-95%; A-: 90-95%
B+: 85-90%; B: 80-85%; B-: 75-80%
C+: 70-75%; C: 65-70%; C-: 60-65%
D+: 55-60%; D: 50-55%: D-: 45-50%
F < 45%
Any concerns about grading errors must be noted in writing and submitted to your TF within one week of receiving the grade.

### Graduate-credit:

Students taking this course for graduate credit are expected to do more work and perform at higher standards than undergraduate-credit students. In particular, we may assign additional tasks in homeworks for graduate-credit students and we expect a more comprehensive final project.



## Course Policies

### Class Norms
For each class and lab, please take care to work through and complete the week’s asynchronous materials and quizzes,

### Attendance
*College students:* Except for DCE and exempt students, it is important that you attend and proactively participate during the labs and live class each week. We understand, however, that certain factors may occasionally interfere with your ability to attend these in-person sessions. You can miss class or labs up to four times during the semester without any negative consequences. After that, it will affect your participation grade. Please let us know as soon as possible if you have reoccurring extenuating circumstances that affect your ability to attend class or labs. We will ask you for an email confirmation from your resident dean and will try to work out an agreeable solution with you and your team.

*DCE students:* Attendance for both the virtual class section and the virtual lab are strongly encouraged, but not mandatory. You might be excused from the virtual class or lab on an individual basis.

### Late Policy
Each student is given two late days for homework assignments at the beginning of the semester. A ‘late day’ extends the individual homework deadline by 24 hours without penalty.

No more than two late days may be used on any assignment. If you have already used all of your late days for the semester, we will deduct points for each day you submit your homework late. Late days are intended to give you flexibility: you can use them for any reason – no questions asked. You don't get any bonus points for not using your late days. Also, you can only use late days for homework deadlines – all other deadlines (e.g., quizzes, project milestones, etc.) are hard.

If you have a verifiable medical condition or other special circumstances that interfere with your coursework please let us know as soon as possible. You will need to provide a written note or email from a medical professional or your resident dean confirming your inability to participate in course work.

### Collaboration Policy
We expect you to adhere to the Harvard Honor Code at all times. Failure to adhere to the honor code and our policies may result in serious penalties, up to and including automatic failure in the course and reference to the ad board.

You may discuss your homework and labs with other students, but you are expected to be intellectually honest and give credit where credit is due. In particular:

* If you work on labs in pairs, you may submit the same lab notebook as your partner, but you must add their name to your notebook submission;
* You have to complete your homework and weekly quizzes entirely on your own;
* You may discuss your homework with your lab partner of that week. You can discuss your code structure and help each other debugging, however, you may not share homework code.
* you cannot share your homework code with anyone else, including on EdStem;
* you may not submit the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another; and
* you may not provide or make available solutions to individuals who take or may take this course in the future.
* If the assignment allows it and for your projects, you may use third-party libraries and example code, so long as the material is available to all students in the class and you give proper attribution. Do not remove any original copyright notices and headers.

*DCE Students:* You are responsible for understanding Harvard Extension School policies on academic integrity (https://extension.harvard.edu/for-students/student-policies-conduct/academic-integrity/Links to an external site.) and how to use sources responsibly. Stated most broadly, academic integrity means that all course work submitted, whether a draft or a final version of a paper, project, take-home exam, online exam, computer program, oral presentation, or lab report, must be your own words and ideas, or the sources must be clearly acknowledged. The potential outcomes for violations of academic integrity are serious and ordinarily include all of the following: required withdrawal (RQ), which means a failing grade in the course (with no refund), the suspension of registration privileges, and a notation on your transcript.

Using sources responsibly (https://extension.harvard.edu/for-students/support-and-services/using-sources-effectively-and-responsibly/Links to an external site.) is an essential part of your Harvard education. We provide additional information about our expectations regarding academic integrity on our website. We invite you to review that information and to check your understanding of academic citation rules by completing two free online 15-minute tutorials that are also available on our site. (The tutorials are anonymous open-learning tools.)

### Accessibility
*College students:* Any student receiving accommodations through the Accessible Education Office should email their AEO letter to <jbeyer@g.harvard.edu> as soon as possible. Failure to do so may prevent us from making appropriate arrangements.

*DCE students:* Harvard Extension School is committed to providing an inclusive, accessible academic community for students with disabilities and chronic health conditions. The Accessibility Services Office (ASO) (https://extension.harvard.edu/for-students/support-and-services/accessibility-services/Links to an external site.) offers accommodations and supports to students with documented disabilities. If you have a need for accommodations or adjustments, contact Accessibility Services directly via email at accessibility@extension.harvard.edu or by phone at 617-998-9640.
